Several geographical coordinate reference systems are utilized in practice. One of the most used is the WGS84 coordinate system â€“ usually known as GPS coordinates. Indeed, there are other coordinate systems used, such ETRS89 in the European area. We permit to use all of them to describe to localization of a POI. The constructed coordinate system in a point defined by any coordinates of a coordinate reference system has its x-axis and the y-axis as tangents of the reference rotation ellipsoid/cylinder and thereby, the y-axis pointing north and the x-axis pointing west. The z-axis is collinear to the surface normal of this ellipsoid/cylinder.
