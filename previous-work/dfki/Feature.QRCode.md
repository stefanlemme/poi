If the physical POI object has a marker attached, we are able to provide reliable AR applications. This can be very different types of markers, e.g. a QR-Code.

With the QR-Code an additional scenario besides the usual tracking is imaginable. By encoding a URL into the QR-Code, which redirects the user to our POI web application, we can show the currently scanned POI using our application and hence, attract new user for our platform and application in that fashion.

Attributes of type Feature.QRCode { Feature( method = qrcode ) }:
* **code : string**
* bitfield : array of bits
