#### Points of Interest (POI) ####

This proposal of a data model is a flexible, extensible and generic approach of a format specification to handle points of interest.
We like to call them places of interest as they can be not only points.
The format support several features to find, locate and map POIs.
Furthermore, arbitrary content can be attach to POIs.

#### Usage ####

There is a mapping for JSON and a json-schema to validate poi data.
